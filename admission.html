					</h5>
					<p>Depending on the grade level and program to which your child is applying, they may be required to undergo an assessment. This assessment helps us determine their academic readiness and ensures that they are placed in the appropriate grade level and program that best suits their needs and abilities. Our assessments are designed to be fair, objective, and reflective of our commitment to academic excellence.</p>

					<p>Once we have received your child's application, we will invite you and your child for an interview with members of our admissions team. This interview provides an opportunity for us to get to know your family better, understand your child's interests, strengths, and areas for growth, and discuss how Excel International Schools can support their educational journey. It's also a chance for you to ask any questions you may have about our school community, curriculum, extracurricular activities, or the admission process.</p>

Once a decision has been made, you will receive an acceptance letter welcoming your child to Excel International Schools!</p>
